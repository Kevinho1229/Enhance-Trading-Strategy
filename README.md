Author: Kevin Ho
Date: February 25, 2025

Overview
This project applies machine learning to improve the pin bar trading strategy for the Hang Seng Index (HSI) using the "33 World-Wide Stock Market Indices Data" from Kaggle. The analysis focuses on identifying potential market movements based on candlestick patterns.

Methodology
Data Cleaning: Historical data from 1997 to 2022 is processed, ensuring proper formatting and handling of missing values.
Pin Bar Strategy: Criteria for bullish and bearish pin bars are defined to generate trading signals.
Machine Learning Models: k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest are utilized, culminating in an ensemble model that enhances predictive accuracy.
Results
The ensemble model achieved a success rate of 72.24%, significantly outperforming the traditional pin bar strategy's 34.69%.
